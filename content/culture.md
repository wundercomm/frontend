## WunderComm Culture (Hacker not Hackers)

10 principles of hacker culture for non-hackers.

### 1. SOLVES PROBLEMS

The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved, and a good hacker is constantly looking for new ways to apply his creativity. This is a lot of fun, but the kind of fun that requires effort and effort needs motivation. For example, successful athletes are motivated by getting their bodies to perform and pushing their own limits. Similarly, to be a hacker, you must enjoy solving problems, honing your skills, and exercising your intelligence. You must also develop a kind of faith in your ability to learn. The belief is that even if you don't know everything you need to solve a problem if you tackle just one part and learn from it, you'll learn enough to solve the next and so on until you're done.

### 2. DOING IS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN TALKING

In our effort to fit in, achieve consensus, and be accepted, we are often tempted to talk instead of do. Boast, appear similar to others, or theorize instead of simply demonstrating. The problem is that talking does not lead to results while doing forces us to create.

### 3. FOLLOW YOUR CURIOSITY

Each of us has a voracious hunger to learn and expand our knowledge. Follow that curiosity wherever it leads you. Jump into the abyss. On the other side, you will probably find satisfaction and personal growth. Most of the time, following your curiosity, can seem scary. The fear stems from the possibility of failure, making a mistake, or the uncertainty of traveling the road less traveled. Just remember that what doesn't challenge you doesn't change you. From this perspective, adversity is your ally. The obstacle is the path.

### 4. DON'T STOP LEARNING

If there is one thing that distinguishes hackers, it is that they are always learning new things. The world is too big and diverse to be satisfied with just knowing a few things. There is always something new to learn; whatever it is, that's the least of it. So be an eternal novice, and keep your appetite for learning intact.

### NO PROBLEM SHOULD BE SOLVED TWICE.

Creativity is a valuable and limited resource. It should not be wasted on reinventing the wheel when so many other new problems are waiting. To behave like a hacker, you must believe that the reasoning time of others is precious, so much so that it is almost your moral duty to share information, solve problems and give away solutions just so that others can focus on new problems instead of solving the same one over and over again. This does not mean that you should consider the existing solutions sacred or that there is only one way to solve something. On the contrary, it is often acceptable and often necessary to decide that something can be done better and improve it. What is not okay is to artificially hinder knowledge sharing. Information wants to be free.

### 6. AUTOMATE WHAT BORES YOU.

Hackers (and creative people in general) should never get bored or waste their time doing stupid, repetitive work because when they do, it means they are not doing what only they can: solving new problems. This waste is terrible for everyone. To behave like a hacker, you must believe this enough to want to automate as much as possible, not just for yourself but for everyone else.

### 7. JUDGE ONLY ON THE MERITS

Hackers should be judged only on their hacking skills, not on any false criteria such as race, age, gender, or position.

### 8. GET INVOLVED

To be a hacker is to belong to a community. Share knowledge. Helping others to develop. Outside of that community, many things are going wrong in our world that urgently needs hands and minds willing to fix them. The list is almost endless: global warming, inequality, racism, discrimination, corruption, poverty... What is your cause? A good hacker steps up and gets involved with the reasons that matter to him.

### 9. ATTITUDE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR APTITUDE.

Copying these attitudes will not make you a hacker any more than it would make you an athlete or a rock star. Becoming a hacker will require intelligence, practice, dedication, and hard work. So you must learn to be wary of attitudes and respect skills. Hackers don't let those who are just posturing waste their time, but they love those who demonstrate their abilities. If you admire the ability of others, you will enjoy developing it yourself; hard work and dedication will become a kind of game. That attitude is vital to being a hacker.


### 10. HAVE FUN

Just as early hackers played with their model trains, none of these principles make sense if you don't enjoy and have fun. Life is too short to waste it on what makes us unhappy. "There is no finish line; enjoy the journey."
